// Initializing app 
/* 
1. To create a new app from Vite's standard React template)
    npm create vite@latest react-test -- --template react 

2. cd to react-test dir, install the app's dependencies, and run the app locally (downloads node_packages)
    cd react-test && npm install

3. Start a local dev server and open the app in browser on port 3000 once the server starts
    npm run dev -- --open --port 3000

--- Application Structure ---
1. index.html
    - Vite injects your code into this file so that your browser can run it
    - we dont edit this
    - <title> - editable

2. public
    - static files that will be served directly to your browser without being processed by Vite's build tooling

3. src

4. package.json | package-lock.json ---> contain metadata on the proj

--- Basic React Component ---
import
Component()
export

--- Syntax related notes ---
1. prop vs attributes
    - attribute - to pass values into plain elements
    - props - to pass values into React components
            - parent components down to child components

2. useState - Hook (A hook is used to use React's features in a component)
