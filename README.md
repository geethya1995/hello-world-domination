# Hello, World Domination

Welcome to **Hello, World Domination**, my quest for coding supremacy! 

- Small projects and demos to explore new languages, frameworks, and tech.
- Quick tips, syntax secrets, and mind-blowing insights.
- Battles fought and won against bugs and quirks.

Just another washed-up techy trying to carve a path to tech mastery, one "Hello, World" at a time.
